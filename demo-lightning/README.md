# Adding Lightning component using code (demo-lightning)

You can use the SharinPix Lightning component on your Lightning pages. This demo will show you how to use the component and also how to change the album ID and/or height of the SharinPix component dynamically.

## Implementation Steps

The SharinPixLightningWrapper Lightning Component bundle can be found [here](src/aura/SharinPixLightningWrapper).

If you wish to preview it using a Lightning Application, feel free to use the [SharinPixDemoWrapperApp](src/aura/SharinPixDemoWrapperApp).
