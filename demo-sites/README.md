# Albums on public VisualForce sites (demo-sites)

You can make albums available to external parties through the internet using VisualForce sites.

## Implementation Steps

The Apex controller (with API version 31) can be found [here](src/classes/SharinPixDemoSite.cls).

The corresponding VisualForce page is found [here](src/pages/SharinPixDemoSite.page).

Donâ€™t forget to add the the album id in the controller!  
Next, create a Site and give permission to the VisualForce that has been created.
