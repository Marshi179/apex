# Add the download option to your images

Allow your image viewers to download the full version of images they want to save.

## Implementation Steps

The Apex controller (with API version 37) can be found [here](src/classes/SharinPixDemoDownload.cls).

The corresponding VisualForce page is found [here](src/pages/SharinPixDemoDownload.page).

Note that the download icon is always available to the uploader.
